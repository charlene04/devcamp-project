2. The Products are only marketable within nigeria.

3. One product can be checked out per time


#Issues faced

It is a good thing that our creativity is being put to test, but I know that my design skills aren't that good. It would have been easier if we had UI/UX track. They provide designs, then the developers work with the designs. All the same, the journey is worth it!
